<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<p align="center">
<img src="images/hero.png" alt="">
</p>

<p>
This implementation of Battleship was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The focus of the project was to be test driven development. Throughout the development of the game I used the JEST JavaScript Testing Framework to write a suite of tests for the parts of the codebase where it made sense.
</p>

### Built With

- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [JEST](https://jestjs.io/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Features

<p>

</p>

Battleship currently has the following features:

- Desktop and mobile support.

- The user can place any of their 5 ships in any order in any of the cardinal directions. Right click will rotate the ship on desktop, and pressing the Rotate button will accomplish the same in mobile. A preview of the current rotation is displayed on a small gameboard.

</p>

- Gameplay is based on the classic Hasbro boardgame. Click on a square to attempt to locate the enemies ships. When all ships are sunk, you win.

- Messages denoting hit, miss, or ship sunk are displayed.

- The user can reset the game at any time.
